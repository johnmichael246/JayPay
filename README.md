Congrats on your installation of JayPay! This README will make sure you become well aquainted with the workings of JayPay and

JayPay is a Payroll app that will allow a user to maintain an employee database, and process (as of now) bi-weekly payroll and specialty check runs. Taxes are calculated and stored for quarterly payroll reports and EOY employer responsiblitites.

**2.TECHNOLOGIES USED**
This application was built using;
**-** HTML5
**-** CSS3
**-** Ruby on Rails
**-** JQuery

In this App makes use of Materlialize's grid system and CCS library.  

**3.GETTING STARTED** 
Click 
[Here](https://jaypayroll.herokuapp.com/) to open the application once youve finished the readMe and are ready to process your first payroll.  
  
First things first, you have to sign up as a user to be enabled to move through the site. Normally your company's administrator(or you yourself) will sign you up, but for now you can sign up to take a look around the site and see is functionality.

From here, you can edit employees (***Note:*** Employees should **NOT** be deleted in order to preserve their pay and tax history, archive them instead!), search for a specific employee, and navigate through the app using the top navbar. clicking on the payroll tab will take you to the payroll history view, where you can sort through payroll periods and if its time, process your first payroll!

**4.Next Steps**. 
There are so many additional features that I want to implement into this app! Automated archiving , payable bonuses, commisions, and the like, tax logic for all 50 states, wage garnishment implementation, sick time and vacation accrual. Theres so much to be done to make this app even better!
